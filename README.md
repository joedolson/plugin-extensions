# Joe Dolson: Plug-in Extensions

How to use these references:

Every file in this repository can be installed as a plug-in. When installed, it'll perform some action that modifies or extends the behavior of one of my other plug-ins. The files are grouped into folders that should make it clear which plug-in they pertain to. 

To install:

* Cut and paste the code into a new file.
* Save that file with whatever name works for you, making whatever changes you need.
* Upload the file into /wp-content/plug-ins/
* Go to WordPress > Plugins and activate it. 

With plug-ins that have premium extensions, such as WP Tweets PRO for WP to Twitter, some extensions only work when the premium add-on is also installed. 

These aren't full-scale plug-ins; these are examples for how to use the filters and actions in my plug-ins to extend or customize their functionality. Most examples require editing the code to change how they operate, and don't add any admin options.

Thanks!
